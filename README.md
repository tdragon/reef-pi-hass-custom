# Home Assistant Reef Pi Integration

This custom integration provides a way to monitor sensors data and control equipment connected to [Reef-Pi (An open source reef tank controller based on Raspberry Pi)](http://reef-pi.github.io/) ([GIT repository](https://github.com/reef-pi/reef-pi/releases)).

## Installation

### Using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (recommended)

This integration can be installed using HACS.
To do it add custom *integration* repository using url: `https://github.com/tdragon/reef-pi-hass-custom/`.
Then search for Reef Pi in the *Integrations* section.

### Manual
To install this integration manually you have to download the content of this repository to `config/custom_components/reef-pi-hass-custom` directory:
```bash
mkdir -p custom_components/reef_pi
cd custom_components/reef_pi
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/tdragon/reef-pi-hass-custom/releases/latest | grep "/reef_pi.zip"|cut -d : -f 2,3|tr -d \"| wget -i -
unzip reef_pi.zip
rm reef_pi.zip
```
After that restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration
Install integration from UI (Configuration --> Integrations --> + --> Search for `reef pi`)
Configuration options:
- Host (http://ip.address or https://ip.address)
- user name
- password
  
## Usage
Integration creates temperature sensor for each sensor connected to Reef PI: `sensor.{reef-pi name}_{temperature_sensor_name}`
Additionally, it creates one sensor for CPU temperature: `sensor.{reef_pi_name}`

For each equipment configured in Reef Pi an outlet entity is created: `switch.{reef_pi name}_{equipment_name}`

Additional entities include:
- `switch.{reef_pi name}_display` to toggle the reef-pi display on or off.
- `button.{reef_pi name}_reboot` and `button.{reef_pi name}_poweroff` for rebooting or shutting down the controller.

## NOTE: How to "fix" intermittent pH readings
On some installations of this addon, it can cause Reef Pi to intermittently drop the reading from both the Reef Pi graph/database and in Home Assistant.

To fix this, in Home Assistant go to Settings > Integrations > Reef-Pi integration and under "Integration entries" click on "Configure" and select "Disable pH sensor" and click on "Submit" and then click on the 3 vertical dots and select "Reload"

To bring in pH sensor readings into Home Assistant you will need to enable the MQTT functionality from within the Reef Pi systems interface.
